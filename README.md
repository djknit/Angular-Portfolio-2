# Angular-Portfolio
### My original portfolio rewritten using AngularJS

#### Version 2
This is the second repository that I created for this purpose. I was having trouble serving the first version and I wanted to reorganize the project, so it seemed easiest to start over with a clean project and add things back in one-at-a-time.

## Attributions
I modeled the organization of this app off of the [`angular-phonecat` app](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat) from the [tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial) on the AngularJS [website](https://angularjs.org/).
