      About Me
    </h2>
    <p class="about">
      <span class="placeholder">&nbsp;</span> I am a Full-Stack Developer
      with a passion for creating user-friendly, functional tools that
      address real-world problems. I am proficient at using HTML, CSS, and
      Javascript to create complete dynamic web-pages with complex
      functionality and precise positioning. I am detail-oriented and
      well organized. These qualities helped me to succeed in earning both
      a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in
      chemistry in my four years at the University of Kansas. It is my
      lifelong passion for mathematics that drew me towards computer
      programming. I believe that writing code and practicing mathematics
      require very similar skill sets. My experience writing mathematical
      proofs gave me an understanding of the same logical structures that
      are used in programming. I am able to succeed in fast paced,
      team-driven environments. I can follow directions well, or take
      initiative where appropriate.

    <p class="about" ng-style="$ctrl.lastPStyle()" ng-class="$ctrl.openOrClosed()">
      I was born and raised in Manhattan KS. I moved to Lawrence to attend KU and have stayed there
      ever since. My interests include all things related to math, science, and music.
      I enjoy coding because it, like math, involves the manipulation of precisely
      defined objects and rules. I am currently working to
      establish and sharpen my skills as a web developer. As I continue to
      build my knowledge of web-based development, I hope to also continue
      to expand my knowledge to include other areas of software development.
